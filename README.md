# Generative AI Product Catalog

> NOTE: This repository has been refactored into two distinct
> sections, experiments and demos. In the **experiments** directory
> you'll find Python notebooks and data sets that show
> much of the evolution prior to the Gemini and Gemma Era.
> In the **demos** directory you'll find working end-to-end
> demonstration artifacts.

Please use the README files in each module to determine how to best
use, build, and run the artifacts.
